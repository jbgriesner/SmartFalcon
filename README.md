# what_are_the_odds

This is home to _what_are_the_odds_, a simple minimalistic web application project that displays odds that Millenium Falcon reaches the Rebel forces before the Empire.
The solution is deployed on my personal server.
You can test my implementation online on griesner.net/what_are_the_odds

## How to run the code

### Basic assumption
- universe.db well formed

## Algorithmic solution

1/ Generate all paths

why DFS ?
allows to make the computations once and then everything is ok for the uploading file

Complexity analysis: enormous!

## Why Rocket & Technical choices

Rocket framework offers a central point to manage front and back in a simple way.
It takes in charge the routing, the pre-processing and the post-processing of user queries.

## Personal notes

From a personal point of view I really enjoyed to work on this project for the following reasons:
-
-
- it was the first time I used Rocket. I was only used to iron, actix...

Of course my implementation leaves room for many improvements.
Optimization
- I think tests are 100% necessary
